# CarServiceWolfpack
Service for a car cleaning company using Ruby on Rails

Request:
You are in charge of creating a software for a Car Cleaning Service. It takes 2 hours to process one request and can process two cars at a time. Your software needs to let the users know when to pick up the car. 

Write a ruby program which determines the pickup date and time, knowing the functioning schedule of the Car Cleaning Service.

Please note that there can be edge cases when a customer may need to pick up the car the next day or even next week.
Also, you need to write unit tests to cover all the scenarios for the car schedule.
